# Wordpress

Step 1: Install WordPress and a theme
Chalets and Caviar, an agency in Aspen, Colorado, has hired you to create their website. It has around 15 luxury chalets for sale and other chalets available to rent.

In the project, you'll add:

- A dozen chalets total, with a mix of for sale and for rent (make them separate!)

- A contact page with contact details and a functional contact form

- A WordPress theme that makes logical sense for the client's requests

Step 2: Configure access and documentation
You will need to create:

- An administrator account for the agency director

- An administrator account for the developer (you!), if it does not already exist

- Editor accounts for two other agency employees

Once you've created these accounts, you'll provide WordPress instructions to the agency within a PDF of 3 to 5 pages. Bear in mind that they are not experts in creating websites; make sure you're very clear about how to add new chalets, edit existing ones, etc., so they have what they need in terms of instructions.
